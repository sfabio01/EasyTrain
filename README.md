# EasyTrain

A Flutter app I made for fun. It lets you easily check the train timetable of your preferred route, including delays and crowding. It only works with Trenord trains.

## Getting Started
The app is not available in the stores. You need to download and build the project to install the app on your device. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
